I can't recall when it was, but I'd had the idea of writing posts that were a series of short posts on whatever it was that was on my mind. I often have thoughts that would make a longer post but either a lack of time or being put off by the mental effort results in me not postin at all. 

The idea of posting in small chunks was twofold; I'd find it easier to post something at all, and it could actually help my thought processes as well.

Can I try again to implement this idea?
